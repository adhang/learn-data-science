# Learn Data Science
## About This Repo
This is my documentation on learning data science. It contains some of my projects that were used to hone my knowledge and skill in data science and machine learning.

## Notes
- I build my projects from various places, such as local Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or Kaggle
- For some reason, I won't upload all the datasets used in my projects (but I'll try to provide as much as I can!)
- If my project is created on Kaggle, you can open the Notebook file and easily click `Open in Kaggle` to see the dataset
